# Amazin

A service that generates URLs that will direct your visitors to their local Amazon. 

For example:

[https://amazin.donovanh.now.sh/B07R9V95NX](https://amazin.donovanh.now.sh/B07R9V95NX)

The above should direct you to your local Amazon for my CSS Animation book. Or you can see your local Amazon homepage here:

[https://amazin.donovanh.now.sh/go](https://amazin.donovanh.now.sh/go)

Visit [the Amazin site](https://amazin.donovanh.now.sh) to try it out.
